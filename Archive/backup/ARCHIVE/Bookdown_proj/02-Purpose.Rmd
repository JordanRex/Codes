# **Purpose** {-}
- To ensure seamless transition of the entire pipeline to another entity
- Complete technical documentation of the entire Turnover process from scratch to final adoption/health monitoring
- Complete manual processes documentation involved in the pipeline
- To create modules that can be scaled/leveraged across the organization in other problems
- To ensure a viable consumption pipeline that maximizes the ROI potential of the whole process
    - The generic process flow across the various individual modules
    - Perspective:
        - **Level** - Actionable steps
        - **Order** - Chronological order along the time and implementation dimensions (Linear. No parallelizable steps)
        - **Audience** - Primarily intended for a Data Scientist (few existing steps will be translated to a Data Engineer/BI developer)
